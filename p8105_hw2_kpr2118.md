## Problem 1

Define a path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_trash_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    path = path_to_trash_data,
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls), 
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data for 2018 and 2017\!

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
  sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
  skip = 1 
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
  sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
  skip = 1 
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation. Made ‘helper’ tibble for numeric and
character representation of month, then merge with month number key,
with the precipitation dataset.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12, 
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

precip_df = 
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month") 

precip_df = 
  precip_df %>% 
  select(-month) %>% 
  select(year, month = "month_name", total)
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, including some
specific kinds of trash.There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include monthly precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

## Problem 2

Read the NYC Transit dataset and begin to clean.

``` r
transit_df = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = "TRUE", NO = "FALSE")) %>% 
  mutate(entry = as.logical(entry))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains information from the NYC Transit Subway Entrance
and Exit data. It has information on each line including stations,
station locations, routes served, entrance type, entrance availability,
vending availability, and ada compliance. There are a total of 1868 rows
and 19 columns in this dataset. So far, I have cleaned up names,
selected variables of interest, and converted the ‘entry’ variable from
character into a logical variable. The data are relatively tidy but
there could be more done to make it even more so… possibilities include
organizing the arrangement of information or making some variables more
distinct. In this dataset:

  - There are 465 distinct stations.

  - 84 stations are ADA compliant.

  - 43 station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance

Now I will reformat route number and route name into distinct variables.

``` r
transit_df = 
  transit_df %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(route1:route11), as.character) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11, 
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name",
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(route_name) %>% 
  relocate(line:station_longitude, route_name, route_number, entrance_type:ada)
```

Now we can read things such as…

  - 60 distinct stations serve the A train

  - Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

Read in and clean selected FiveThirtyEight datasets…

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(year:day), as.integer)   
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
polsmonth_df =
    tibble(
      month = 1:12,
      month_name = month.name
    )

pols_df = 
    left_join(pols_df, polsmonth_df, by = "month")  

pols_df = 
  pols_df %>% 
  select(-month) %>% 
  select(year, month = "month_name", day:rep_dem) %>% 
  mutate(
    president = case_when( 
      prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
      prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
      prez_gop == 2 ~ "gop",
    )
  )

pols_df = 
  pols_df %>% 
  select(year, month, president, gov_gop:rep_gop, gov_dem:rep_dem)
```
